# Cafe Finder

Cafe Finder is a simple web application that helps users find nearby cafes using their current location. Built with vanilla JavaScript and the Google Maps JavaScript API, this project focuses on clean UI design, real-world API usage, and browser-based interactivity.

The goal of this project was to practice working with external APIs, geolocation, and front-end layout while creating something practical and user-friendly.
